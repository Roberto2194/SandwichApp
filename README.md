# SandwichUp

# Introduction or “how sandwiches made us the people we are today”

Sandwiches are a way of living. You can tell so much of a person from them. You know how they say? “Tell me what you eat and I will tell you what you are”. Well, that’s something that more than anything else applies to sandwiches. Think about it: they enclose everything that makes us incredibly fallacious humans. Hamburgers, bacon, cheddar, mayo, fried chicken, salami and those incredibles pickled cucumbers… it’s basically impossible not to fall into temptation when you find yourself facing one of those.

And we were no different. Yum!

# The Challenge

So there we were. It was the beginning of February and a new challenge was awaiting for us at the horizon: find a way to help those students, and/or workers, who live away from home toward an App. Easy to say it, a little harder to make it. So we rolled up our sleeves, gathered together all of our willingness, and got busy working on it.

First thing we did was going out talking to real people. Workers, students and all those ones that could help us figure out a solution for our challenge. To do so we had to confront, for the very first time, the real feel of interviewing people and asking them about their everyday problems, their struggles. The data we collected was clear, the main problems concerning students and workers are: eating (both cooking, and being healthy) and cleaning.

Could’ve been the unconscious will to help our neglected personas or maybe that beautiful, soapy smell you get after taking a good shower that tricked us but, for one reason or another, we went for the cleaning. And, yeah, long story short, it couldn’t be done. We weren’t able to come up with anything that either social medias or simple calls couldn’t do already. Worse of all: we spent a whole week planning for an App that was basically useless, and that had no functionality.

So, tired but not yet disengaged, and with few time left on the clock, we went for the second issue regarding students: eating. To avoid you a long boring talk, I’ll schematise what we found out:

    Most students/workers lack cooking skills, and can cook properly few to no recipes;
    So they end up cooking the same thing over and over, and that brings us to a second problem: the boringness of eating the same thing;
    Cooking the same thing in turn leads us to another problem: the willing to stay healthy without being able to do so;
    And what does all that takes us? Trash food of course. That’s our fourth problem.

And, as if that wasn’t enough, there is more: most students/workers don’t even have lunch at home. They usually prepare a meal to go the day before, or (you knew it was coming) a sandwich in the morning, before leaving the house.

(This data was enforced even more during further research on the topic, where we found out that more than half Italian students (57%) consume food prepared at home!)

So here we are at last: sandwiches!

We wanted our App to incorporate all of those four findings since they were interconnected with each other. And so, resolving one could’ve made a cascade effect with all the others. And so we did.

The most important thing of every experience is learn something from it. So we want to conclude this story telling you what we’ve learned: be hungry for mistakes, for the more you make them the more you can learn; don’t give up so easily; collaboration is the key to success and more importantly relax, have a SandwichUp!
